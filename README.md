# Crowdfunding-Extract-Load-Transform
## Overview
This project takes data from a crowdfunding campaign to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and SQL. We extracted and transformed the data with pandas and numpy, created four CSV files from the original dataset, engineered an ERD and SQL Table Schema, and uploaded the transformed csv file data into a PostgresSQL server database. We ran SQL queries to verify our data cleaning and transformation.
# Prerequisites   
We used the following dependencies 
* pandas
* numpy

# Steps
* Import dependencies

* Extract Crowdfunding Data by reading the data into a Pandas DataFrame

* Create category and subcategory DataFrames

* Create campaign dataframe

* Extract Contacts Data 

* Create Contacts DataFrame

* Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) using QuickDBD.

* Create a SQL table schema for each CSV file 

* Specify data types in schema

* Saved the database schema into PostgreSQL server named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql

* Created a new Postgres database called crowdfunding_db

* Used a SQLSelect query to verify data
